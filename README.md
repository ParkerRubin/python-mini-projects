# Python Mini Projects

Collection of small Python projects built for practice and fun. These
mini-apps explore basic game logic, user interaction, algorithms, and 
beginner–intermediate software design in Python.

## Projects

- `rock_paper_scissors/` – Classic RPS game with input validation and score tracking.
- `wordle_clone/` – Text-based Wordle-style guessing game using string logic and feedback.
- `number_guess/` – Random number guessing game with hints and attempt counting.
- `hangman/` – Command-line hangman with word lists and life tracking.
- `password_generator/` – Random password generator with length and character options.
- `calculator/` – Simple calculator handling basic arithmetic operations.

Each folder contains its own `main.py` and a short `README.md` explaining 
what the project does and how to run it.
